Greetings, TAs of NUS! camNUS is a **desktop app** for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to **manage their contacts.**

TAs can also add classes, assessments, and add their **existing contacts** as students. camNUS allows TAs to manage these components in one place.
For example,they can track attendance, class participation and assessment marks of their class.

camNUS is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
<br/><br/>As of now, camNUS is designed for use with **one module only** and thus all the tutorial classes in camNUS belongs to one module and **a student can only join one tutorial class**.

## Features 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* All parameters are **case-sensitive**.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…`​ can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters are to be used with valid prefixes specified in the command. For a full list of valid prefixes, click [here](#valid-prefixes).

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

* Tags do not add any functionality to camNUS and are present solely to allow the users to keep track of any additional information.
