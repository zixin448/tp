### Project: camNUS

###Overview:
camNUS is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage assessments and class participation among students based on their contacts. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add `Student` to tutorial
  * What it does: Allows the user to `add` `Student` to an existing tutorial. Replaces the original `Person` contact with a `Student` contact.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary for the app to function because Teaching Assistants (Target Audience) will have to be able to add `Student` into their class.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects commands to be added in later phase of the project. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. We finalised on the 
  implementation where all `Student` contacts will have to be created from an existing person contact. This helps to ensure that all `Student` are valid and when a TA removes `Student` from a class
  (e.g After the academic year ends), the TA will not lose the contact in camNUS. Some interesting parts of creating this feature at the earlier phase of the project was exploring storage 
  of a new `Student` type and displaying optional fields in the `Person` card.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find a `Person`/`Student` by prefix and partial keyword matching
  * What it does: Allows the user to `find` a `Person` or a `Student` by prefixes. The `findByPrefix` implementation allows for partial keyword matching.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product functionalities and user experience because it gives user the flexibility of searching for a contact 
  by specifying the field that they want to search for. Partial keyword matching makes the adapted find command less stringent.
  * Highlights: The implementation of this feature matches the respective field from the first character of each word in the field value. This is a slightly more complicated
  implementation process to achieve the standard of the usual partial finding features in already existing applications.
  * Credits: Adapted from the original Find Command in AB3.
